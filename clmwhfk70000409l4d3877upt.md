If you're a person who is venturing into the ever-expanding universe of cloud services and tools geared towards data science workloads, you've probably stumbled upon Microsoft's [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) platform.

In this post, we'll dissect why [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) should (or shouldn't) join your tech arsenal. This is just the start of a series of posts where we'll explore the pros and cons of  [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) in greater depth. As we become more proficient in using this tool, the advantages and limitations will become even clearer. So, stay tuned for a deeper dive into the world of [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2)! ðŸš€

## Control over Model Training and Management

One of the standout features of [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2), in comparison with other Azure services related to data science ([Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/) and [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/)), is the control it provides over model training and management. For seasoned data scientists, this is crucial. You get to customize and fine-tune every aspect of your machine learning workflows, including [custom ML pipeline components](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-component-pipeline-python?view=azureml-api-2), which are self-contained pieces of code that perform steps in the pipeline; custom training to train [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), etc. models; and custom deployment to deploy a model to an endpoint in a custom container, etc.

But, and it's a reasonable "but" here ðŸ¤”, this level of control might be overwhelming. If you're just starting your journey in the world of data science, the sheer number of options, settings, and integrations in [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) could leave you scratching your head. In such cases, fear not! The [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) studio offers great functionality to help you kick start your machine learning adventures.

## Ease of Getting Started

You can quickly implement a machine learning solution for well-known machine learning problems with [AutoML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2). This can be completely done in the [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) studio, which allows you to manage your workload via a user interface. [This](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2) is a great example of how to train a classification model with no-code [AutoML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml?view=azureml-api-2) using automated machine learning in [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) studio.

## Comprehensive Lifecycle Management

[Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) doesn't just stop at model training; it covers the complete machine learning lifecycle. The [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) studio is designed to be intuitive, making it easier for you to develop, train, deploy, and manage your models. This streamlined experience is advantageous for productivity and collaboration, especially in larger teams or organizations.

However, there's a flip side. Some data scientists who crave advanced customization or require specific tool integrations might find [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) slightly restrictive. It's a trade-off between ease of use and the ability to tailor every aspect of your workflow to your precise needs.

### Version Management

Now, let's shift our focus to another critical aspect: version management. Version control can be a tricky issue in the world of machine learning. Keeping track of different model versions, datasets, and experiments is crucial but can be a logistical nightmare. [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2) comes to the rescue here by automating model and data version management. This reduces the risk of conflicts and ensures that you can easily roll back to a previous state if something goes wrong.
